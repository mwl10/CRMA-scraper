More than seventy-five paintings and works on paper help tell the story of the new style of painting which developed at the end of the nineteenth century—one that emphasized light and atmospheric conditions, rapid or loose brushstrokes, and a focus on brightly colored scenes from everyday life.Some of the artists featured in the exhibition include Edgar Degas and Mary Cassatt, who exhibited in the official Impressionist exhibitions in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s. Among the earliest American artists to embrace the style were John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, John Henry Twachtman, Childe Hassam, and Frank W. Benson. A host of American artists who embraced the style by the turn of the century including Robert Lewis Reid, William Paxton, Chauncey Ryder, and Guy Wiggins, are highlighted in the exhibition.Across the Atlantic: American Impressionism through the French Lens is organized by the Reading Public Museum, Reading, Pennsylvania.  Local support for this exhibition and accompanying educational programming has been provided by The McIntyre Foundation, UFG Insurance, and the Lil’ Drug Store Products, Inc. Corporate Donor-Advised Fund of the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation.  Educational programming for Across the Atlantic has been supported in part by the Marvin Cone Art Club.  Additional annual support has been provided by the Hotel-Motel Tax Fund, the Iowa Arts Council, a division of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs and the National Endowment for the Arts, the Program Grant Fund of the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation, members of the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art, and contributors to the Museum’s Annual Fund.  "

Making prints for more than 65 years--first in his native Argentina, then in New York City, and for more than 55 years in Iowa City, Iowa--Lasansky's generous gift of prints in the 1980s and 1990s made it possible for the Museum to present a wide range of the artist's works, changing all four galleries every six months. Best known for large-scale prints in which he uses multiple plates and full ranges of color, Lasansky combines a spectrum of graphic techniques including etching, drypoint, aquatint, and engraving. Throughout his stylistic evolution, he created eloquent figural statements that are colorful, fresh, and spontaneous. "

Given the CRMA’s rich history of presenting the art of local artists—especially when they’ve achieved a certain milestone or completed a specific new body of work—the idea of displaying a 10-year retrospective of Zeran’s work during the CRMA’s 125th anniversary year seems fitting. One of the very few local artists to have spent her entire painting career working abstractly, Zeran’s work will challenge viewers to see her subtle but significant evolution over the course of the past 10 years. Constantly exploring, Zeran has crafted different methods of mark-making to accompany her evolution in palette and scale. The exhibition will not only trace the trajectory of her career, it will also include a site-specific installation created especially for this exhibition."

While known for his iconic American Gothic (Art Institute of Chicago) and other Regionalist works from his mature style, Grant Wood was constantly exploring styles, techniques, and media. This exhibition will bring together works from both the CRMA collection as well as from private collections to celebrate Wood’s inquisitive mind. Rarely seen paintings will be joined with diverse metalwork pieces, drawings, and studies to construct a fuller view of Wood’s genius."

The fact that thousands of parodies of American Gothic exist, dating back several decades, speaks to the enduring inspiration of one of America’s greatest works of art. This exhibition—a first for the Cedar Rapids Museum of Art—will look at many of these parodies—some in the flesh on the gallery’s walls and many others digitally projected in an attempt to share the incredible reach of this iconic painting. From Bill and Hillary Clinton to Leonardo and Mona Lisa to RuPaul as male and female, these parodies speak to how this one painting serves as the basis for looking at various contemporary people and issues. Wood’s impactful 1930 painting continues to inspire “artists” of all ages and skills in a playful and humorous way that Wood would no doubt have applauded."

This brief sojourn proved to be pivotal for both artists, enhancing their nascent interest in Impressionism and painting en plein air. While each artist was not to continue painting in this style beyond the early 1930s, this trip to Paris (Wood’s first trip abroad, Cone’s second) was critical to their development as artists. What the artists did, saw, and painted is carefully outlined in Cone’s meticulous and well-written diary of the trip, including where the artists painted on which days. As such, this diary enables the ability to date certain works to the precise date of creation. It also allows viewers to see how each artist depicted the same scene, often in very different terms. "

 Bruce Beasley is one of the nation’s foremost sculptors. Born in Los Angeles in 1939, Beasley studied at Dartmouth College and at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1961, he was included in the seminal exhibition “The Art of Assemblage” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1963, Beasley won the purchase prize in the Paris Biennale, one of the world’s most prestigious international exhibitions.Beasley has been involved with innovation and technology his entire career. In 1960, while a student at the University of California at Berkeley, he helped build the first bronze foundry in an art department. He invented a new process for massive casting of acrylic sculptures and he is currently exploring theuse of virtual reality as a new technology for sculpture – a new direction for the artist. Beasley’s Aurai were created using virtual reality. “When I put on the head gear,” Beasley wrote, “the stylus becomes an extension of my hand, and my imagination…. It is completely spontaneous; if I like something I’ve just created, I continue, elaborate; if not I move on.” For these collages, Beasley selects virtual reality gestures that “sing” and then prints monumental versions of these onto canvas. Beasley then studies the printed gestures and cuts them into fragments – “visual words,” as he calls them. Finally, he moves these fragments around like so many puzzle pieces, twisting, rotating, flipping, and adjusting until an arrangement becomes the wall collages currently on view. Beasley’s sculptures are in the permanent collection of numerous art museums around the world, and he has had more than sixty solo exhibitions and has been included in hundreds of group exhibitions. Beasley has also completed more than fifty monumental sculpture commissions in the United States and abroad, including large works for the Beijing Olympic Games, the World Expo in Shanghai, and the City of Cedar Rapids. This exhibition is the U.S. premiere of his new Aurai series.

John Beckelman’s Horizon Suite is a group of six recently-completed three-dimensional landscapes. Using the expressive potential of clay and a variety of other materials, Beckelman’s work explores the transitional space where the sky meets the land or sea. The horizontal sweep of this space is mediated by intimate moments of surprising texture, shifting light, and fleeting color. Horizon Suite attempts to gently entice the viewer into the inner landscapes and interior spaces of our imagination and memory. Beckelman finds a curious intersection between the seemingly enduring and timeless character of earth and the fleeting yet wonderful impermanence of the world in which we live. John Beckelman's art has been shown in exhibitions throughout the country and he has been the recipient of numerous awards, commissions, and grants. He received his master of fine arts degree in ceramics and his master of science degree in ceramics from Illinois State University. Beckelman is the Robert O. Daniel Professor of Art, Emeritus at Coe College. He lives and works in Cedar Rapids."

Stories about animals have always been a staple of children’s literature. One of the earliest known books aimed at children, the 17th-century publication Orbis sensualium pictus, taught children the alphabet by mimicking animal noises. This trope continued in the early- and mid-20th century, called the Golden Age of children’s book illustration. Drawn from the Zerzanek Collection of Original Art from Children's Literature on loan to the CRMA from the Cedar Rapids Public Library, If We Ran the Zoo looked at the various ways animals have shaped children’s literature, from simple science books to loyal pets to fantastical, talking companions."
